# StayOps

StayOps is a multilingual hotel and accommodation operations platform for field staff and office/admin staff.

The project starts as an internal company operations app and may later become a public product for other accommodation operators.

## Current Status

Stage:

```txt
Internal rollout ready — Phase 13 QA in progress
```

Core operations modules are substantially implemented. Auth/onboarding, cleaning, requests, announcements,
notifications, reservations (Beds24 webhook), Todoist/tasks, projects, linen returns, suggestions, board,
attendance/payroll, annual leave, complaints/reviews, exports, profile/directory, and the admin console are live.
The linked Supabase migration state must be verified against the target project before deployment; local
migration files alone do not prove that a remote environment is current. See
`docs/planning/06-current-status.md` for the detailed implementation log.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Validate the app:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Local Supabase Setup

Create or update `.env.local` with values from the Supabase dashboard:

```txt
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://sspdgzkytkpmquqsfaup.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

Keep the service role key server-only and never paste it into chat or documentation.

## Product Scope

StayOps supports:

- Mobile PWA for field staff and part-time staff
- Admin web app for office/admin users
- Hotel-style buildings

## Documentation Is Source of Truth

All planning, design, technical, and workflow decisions must be reflected in Markdown files.

If code changes behavior, permissions, UI flow, data structure, or technical direction, update the related docs in the same work cycle.

Important:

```txt
No major feature should exist only in code.
```

## Work Process

Use this workflow:

```txt
Plan
Design
Document
Implement
Test
Review
Update docs
Repeat
```

For each feature:

```txt
1. Confirm requirements
2. Update docs
3. Design in Stitch if UI-heavy
4. Implement small vertical slice
5. Test mobile/admin, light mode, ko/ja/en
6. Update docs if implementation differs
```

## AI Collaboration

Codex, Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools must:

- Read relevant docs before making changes
- Follow confirmed decisions
- Update docs when behavior changes
- Not silently change tech stack, permissions, deletion behavior, i18n strategy, or PWA-first direction

## Next Practical Steps

1. Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and add only the secrets required for the target environment.
2. Compare local and remote migration history, then apply every pending migration in order.
3. Sign in at `/auth/login`; use `/onboarding` only when the account still needs profile or membership setup.
4. Run the release/physical-device checks in `docs/planning/13-qa-checklist.md` before operational rollout.
