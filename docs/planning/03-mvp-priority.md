# MVP Priority

## Confirmed Highest-Frequency Mobile Workflows

The mobile app should prioritize the workflows staff use most often in the field.

## Priority 1

### Maintenance Issue Registration

Staff need to quickly report room/property/facility problems.

Important fields:

- Location
- Issue type
- Description
- Photo
- Priority
- Status

### Lost Item Registration

Staff need to quickly register found items.

Important fields:

- Item name
- Found location
- Found date/time
- Photo
- Storage location
- Status

### Cleaning Start and Completion

Staff need to start and finish cleaning work.

Important actions:

- Start cleaning
- Show active timer
- Complete cleaning
- Record total time
- Add note/photo if needed
- Report lost item directly from active cleaning
- Report maintenance issue directly from active cleaning

Cleaning staff assignment is not part of this MVP because the company already uses a separate system for assigning cleaning personnel.

## Priority 2

### Order and Supply Requests

Staff need to request items and supplies.

Important fields:

- Item
- Quantity
- Product/reference URL if available
- Reason
- Location/property
- Priority
- Status

### Announcements

Staff need to read important notices.

Important features:

- Announcement list
- Important notices
- Read tracking
- Target by role/property

## Out of Scope

### Attendance / Clock-In and Clock-Out

> **Updated 2026-06-09: no longer out of scope.** This exclusion was reversed — attendance/clock-in-out is now an approved post-MVP feature batch item. See `docs/planning/01-decision-log.md` → "2026-06-09 / Attendance / Clock-In-Out + Payroll — Scope Change (Approved)" and `docs/planning/15-feature-batch-plan.md`. Attendance capture (PWA QR + GPS) is buildable; payroll calculation stays deferred until wage rules are defined. The text below is kept only as historical context.

~~This is not part of StayOps first scope because the company already uses another app for attendance.~~

### Cleaning Staff Assignment

This is not part of StayOps first scope because the company already uses another system for cleaning personnel assignment.

### Full Inventory Management

This is not part of StayOps first MVP because detailed inventory requirements are not decided yet.

## Mobile Home Screen Implication

The mobile home screen should likely prioritize:

- Today's assigned cleaning/work
- Quick action: maintenance issue
- Quick action: lost item
- Quick action: order request
- Important announcements
- Active cleaning timer if one is running
