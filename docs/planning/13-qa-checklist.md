# Phase 13: Full-System QA Checklist

Last updated: 2026-06-03  
Verification method: code trace + TypeScript build + DB migration check (browser E2E pending)

Use this document as the live gate for internal rollout decisions.  
For the rollout execution steps, see `docs/planning/14-rollout-guide.md`.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

- **Code trace**: reviewed in source without a running browser session.
- **Build verified**: confirmed by `npm run lint` + `npm run build`.
- **DB verified**: confirmed by comparing local migrations against remote Supabase history.
- **Browser E2E**: requires a logged-in session and real device. Mark as Pass only after manual confirmation.
- **Deferred**: intentionally not implemented for MVP; no action needed before rollout.

## 11. Known Issues and Open Risks

### Medium

| ID | Description | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Calendar empty count shows "provisional" amber warning until room master is populated via inventory backfill | Run `scripts/dev/beds24-backfill-room-master.sh` before first operational use |
| R-02 | Browser E2E (actual server action mutations) not verified; all server action checks are code-trace only | Perform manual golden-path pass before first staff use |
| R-03 | Beds24 webhook may miss events if webhook delivery fails; calendar won't update automatically | Run `POST /api/dev/beds24/backfill-reservations` as a recovery path if reservations look stale |

### Low

| ID | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| R-04 | Admin orders page links to mobile order detail (mobile layout on desktop) | Post-MVP: add admin-specific order detail page |
| R-05 | No hard-delete confirmation UX for lost-found / maintenance records | Deferred by design; add in post-MVP cycle |
| R-06 | Google OAuth not implemented; login screen has disabled placeholder | Magic-link is primary and works |
| R-07 | Map tab shows building cards with Google Maps deeplink, no embedded map | Sufficient for operational use |
| R-08 | `<img>` used for client-side blob URL previews in order items (not Next.js Image) | Intentional; Next.js Image does not support blob URLs |

### Not Tested (requires real browser or external service)

- Actual server action execution (all create/update mutations)
- PWA install flow on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Dark mode rendering on real devices
- Push notification delivery (not yet implemented; in-app only)
- Multi-language rendering in production environment
- Real Beds24 webhook delivery end-to-end with live reservation changes

## 12. Release Recommendation

**Status: Conditionally approved for limited internal rollout**

No critical code-level blockers remain as of 2026-06-03. The build passes, all DB migrations are applied, and the majority of the security, routing, and business logic has been verified by code trace. However, server action mutations and device-specific behavior have not been confirmed through browser E2E testing.

Controlled internal rollout may begin once the two required steps below are completed. Phase 13 remains open until browser E2E is confirmed.

### What has been verified

- TypeScript build passes with 0 errors and 0 lint warnings.
- All remote DB migrations are applied and confirmed against local history.
- Auth routing, access control, RLS scope, and permission guards verified by code trace.
- Business logic for cleaning, requests, orders, announcements, notifications, and exports verified by code trace.
- i18n coverage for ko/ja/en confirmed across all production-visible surfaces.

### What has not been verified

- Actual form submission and server action mutations (create, update, status change); requires a browser session.
- Image upload end-to-end (client compression, Storage write, detail display).
- PWA install flow on iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
- Dark mode rendering on real devices.
- Real Beds24 webhook delivery with a live booking change.
- Multi-language rendering in the production Vercel environment.

### Required before first staff use

1. Run `scripts/dev/beds24-backfill-room-master.sh` to populate room master and switch calendar empty count from provisional to authoritative.
2. Perform a manual browser golden-path pass covering: login, cleaning start/complete, order request creation, admin order approval and processing, and notification receipt.
3. Create invite codes at `/admin/settings/invite-codes` for the first staff batch.

### Recommended actions after rollout

- Monitor Supabase logs for server action errors in the first week.
- Confirm Beds24 webhook events are arriving by checking `/admin/calendar` after a real booking change.
- Collect field staff feedback on cleaning workflow and mobile navigation.
- Plan post-MVP cycle: admin order detail page, hard-delete confirmation, Google OAuth.
