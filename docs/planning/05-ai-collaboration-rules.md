# AI Collaboration Rules

## Purpose

StayOps may be worked on with multiple AI tools such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, and others.

This document defines shared rules so all AI assistants follow the same project direction.

## Primary Rule

Before changing code, read the relevant Markdown documents.

Important docs:

- `README.md`
- `docs/planning/01-decision-log.md`
- `docs/planning/04-project-workflow.md`
- Relevant product documents in `docs/product`
- Relevant design documents in `docs/design`
- Relevant engineering documents in `docs/engineering`

## Documentation Must Stay Updated

Any AI that changes behavior, UI, data structure, permissions, or workflow must update the related Markdown docs.

Mandatory order for every change cycle:

```txt
1. Update relevant Markdown docs first (or at minimum in the same cycle before completion)
2. Implement code to match the documented direction
3. Run verification (lint/build/tests)
4. Re-sync docs if implementation-level details changed during coding
```

No feature work is considered complete until docs and code are aligned.

Additional completion rule:

- Every completed task must update the related Markdown docs in the same work cycle.
- "The code is done, docs later" is not an acceptable completion state.
- If coding changed the implementation details, the docs must be reconciled again before the task is closed.

Examples:

- New field added to maintenance request -> update maintenance workflow doc.
- Role permission changed -> update user roles and decision log.
- UI navigation changed -> update mobile/admin navigation docs.
- Tech stack changed -> update engineering docs and decision log.
- Notification changed -> update notification design doc.

## Do Not Invent Against Existing Decisions

AI assistants must not silently override confirmed decisions.

If a confirmed decision seems wrong:

```txt
1. Explain the concern
2. Propose a change
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Update decision log if changed
```

## Current Confirmed Direction

Key confirmed decisions:

- PWA-first MVP
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Supabase Auth/PostgreSQL/Storage/RLS
- Vercel deployment
- Korean/Japanese/English from the first implementation
- Pure-white operational UI with selective Apple-inspired Liquid Glass accents and strong readability
- Light mode only (dark mode deferred until post-launch; removed 2026-06-08)
- Beds24 webhook integration
- Mobile and admin web in one product
- Organization-based multi-tenant structure

## Code Style Principles

When implementation begins:

- Use TypeScript.
- Avoid hardcoded UI strings.
- Use i18n keys for all visible UI text. An automated guard (`npm run check:i18n`, part of `npm test`) fails on hardcoded Korean/Japanese/Kanji literals under `src/app` / `src/components`; legitimate domain data must use an `i18n-ignore` directive with justification.
- This applies to **all feature additions and all feature modifications without exception**.
- Do not ship or stage a feature with Korean-only hardcoded UI copy on the assumption that translation
  can be added later.
- New UX must be **multilingual by design from the first implementation pass**: `ko`, `ja`, and `en`
  must be added together for visible copy.
- Use shared types where possible.
- Keep permissions enforced server-side/database-side, not only in UI.
- Keep mobile PWA and admin web behavior role-aware.
- Prefer small, testable modules.
- Implement code in line with the documented StayOps project flow (`docs/planning/04-project-workflow.md`).
- Do not skip planning/flow constraints even under fast iteration; code quality and workflow consistency are both required.
- If implementation pressure conflicts with the documented flow, pause and update docs/decision log first, then continue coding.

## Project-Flow-First Coding Rule

All assistants must treat the project workflow as an implementation contract, not a reference note.

- Required baseline sequence: `Plan -> Design -> Document -> Implement -> Test -> Review -> Update documentation`.
- For bug-fix hotpaths, investigation and patching can be immediate, but final output must still include doc sync in the same cycle.
- Any behavior that diverges from current docs must be documented before the cycle is closed.

## Design Principles

- Follow Stitch designs when provided.
- Keep Liquid Glass readable and selective.
- Support light mode only (dark mode deferred until post-launch).
- Check Korean, Japanese, and English text lengths.
- Do not prioritize decoration over operational clarity.

### Mandatory Mobile Design Consistency (Hard Rule)

- This rule is mandatory and non-optional.
- Any change to `/mobile/*` must preserve one coherent mobile system: pure-white shell/background, strong readability, and selective Apple-style Liquid Glass accents.
- Liquid Glass is not a full-screen treatment. Use it for floating navigation, bottom sheets, overlays, cards, chips, or other surfaces where translucency improves perceived quality without reducing clarity.
- `MobileShell` is the shared behavior baseline: scroll-aware top chrome, two-line hamburger menu trigger with a shorter bottom line, 78% slide-out side menu, and the current flat white bottom tab bar with center FAB.
- Top bar, bottom tab bar, and bottom-sheet behavior must stay unified across the app unless an explicit documented design decision says otherwise.
- Bottom sheets must use the shared iPhone-style dismissal pattern: drag down from the top touch area / handle, or tap the empty scrim area to dismiss.
- Mixed visual quality between mobile tabs is not acceptable. If consistency is not achieved, the task is incomplete.

## Data and Permission Principles

- Every business record must belong to an organization.
- Do not leak data across organizations.
- Use role-based permissions.
- Part-time Staff can create/view requests but cannot change statuses.
- Order request processing is office-level.
- Price/revenue data should not be shown in StayOps MVP.

## Communication Rule

When an AI makes a change, it should summarize:

- What changed
- Which files changed
- Whether docs were updated
- What remains undecided

## Red Flag Rule

Stop and ask before:

- Changing the selected tech stack
- Changing role permissions
- Changing data deletion behavior
- Adding paid services
- Adding Apple Developer / Google Play dependency
- Changing multilingual strategy
- Changing PWA-first direction

## Project Guardrail Subagents (2026-06-22)

The repo ships **eight read-only Claude Code subagents** under `.claude/agents/` that automate the most common policy checks on every diff. They never write files; they only surface what's stale or unsafe.

| Agent | Triggers on | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `docs-sync-auditor.md` | Any code change | Which `docs/*.md` entries are now stale vs. the diff |
| `i18n-triple-locale-auditor.md` | New text / dictionary keys in `.tsx` | ko / ja / en presence in `src/lib/i18n.ts`; hardcoded strings |
| `mobile-shell-and-ios-pwa-reviewer.md` | `shell/*`, `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`, manifest | iOS Safari / standalone PWA regression checklist |
| `rls-and-org-isolation-auditor.md` | Server actions, queries, migrations | Org scope, service-role guards, RLS policies, role gates |
| `tokyo-timezone-scanner.md` | Any date/time logic change | UTC slicing that bypasses Tokyo helpers |
| `beds24-integration-safety-auditor.md` | `lib/beds24/*`, `api/beds24/*` | Polling regressions, secret leakage, webhook signature checks |
| `migration-impact-mapper.md` | New file under `supabase/migrations/` | Downstream impact on types / queries / docs |
| `image-upload-policy-checker.md` | New / modified image uploader | 5-vs-20 cap, `maxImages`, compression, storage paths |

Invoke explicitly (e.g. "run docs-sync-auditor on this diff") or let Claude Code auto-delegate based on the agent's `description` frontmatter. All agents are read-only (Read / Grep / Glob / `git diff` only). Anything they flag still requires a human to fix; they never edit code.

## Project Persona Expert Agents (실제 작업자, 2026-06-22)

가드 8개와 별개로, `.claude/agents/` 에는 **실제 코드 작업을 수행하는 6명의 전문가 페르소나**가 있습니다. 각 페르소나는 자기 도메인의 CLAUDE.md 룰을 강하게 알고 있고, 작업이 끝나면 자기 영역의 가드 에이전트를 스스로 호출합니다.

| 직원 | 책임 영역 | 도구 | 모델 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-engineer.md` | Server actions (`src/app/**/actions.ts`), `src/lib/*`, API routes, Supabase 통합, 권한 게이트, 알림, Beds24 핸들러 | Read · Edit · Write · Bash · Grep · Glob | opus |
| `frontend-engineer.md` | React/TSX 페이지·컴포넌트, 모바일 셸 사용, 클라이언트 상태, i18n 연결, 폼 UX, App Router | Read · Edit · Write · Bash · Grep · Glob | sonnet |
| `design-engineer.md` | `globals.css`, 도메인 BEM 스타일시트, Tailwind 토큰, 모바일 셸 **시각 계약**(ivory+navy), BottomSheet 표준 | Read · Edit · Write · Grep · Glob | sonnet |
| `debugging-specialist.md` | 버그 재현·원인 격리·로그 분석·회귀 추적·lint/build 디버깅·최소 픽스 | Read · Edit · Bash · Grep · Glob | opus |
| `database-engineer.md` | `supabase/migrations/*`, RLS 정책, `src/types/database.ts`, Beds24 캐시 스키마, RPC/SECURITY DEFINER | Read · Edit · Write · Bash · Grep · Glob | opus |
| `product-docs-architect.md` | `docs/*` 전체 (planning / product / engineering), 결정 로그, current-status, 신규 기능 기획·요구사항 | Read · Edit · Write · Grep · Glob | sonnet |

### 가드와 페르소나의 협업

페르소나는 **일을 한다**. 가드는 **그 결과를 점검한다**. 페르소나의 시스템 프롬프트에는 자기 작업이 끝나면 어떤 가드를 자기가 호출해야 하는지 명시되어 있다 (예: `backend-engineer` → `rls-and-org-isolation-auditor` + `docs-sync-auditor`, `database-engineer` → `migration-impact-mapper` + `rls-and-org-isolation-auditor`).

### 자연어 호출 (한국어 OK)

자동 위임 트리거가 한국어 표현도 포함하도록 작성되었습니다. 예:

- "이 server action 만들어줘" → `backend-engineer`
- "이 화면 만들어줘" → `frontend-engineer`
- "디자인 좀 다듬어줘 / ivory 안 맞아" → `design-engineer`
- "이거 왜 안 돼? / 버그 잡아줘" → `debugging-specialist`
- "마이그레이션 만들어줘 / RLS 정책 추가" → `database-engineer`
- "기획해줘 / 결정 사항 기록 / docs 정리" → `product-docs-architect`

명시적 호출은 그냥 이름을 부르면 됩니다: "frontend-engineer 한테 시켜줘", "database-engineer 가 이 마이그 작성해".

### 거절 패턴

각 페르소나는 자기 영역 밖 요청을 거절하고 적절한 동료에게 위임을 제안합니다 (예: `frontend-engineer` 가 마이그레이션 요청 받으면 "이건 database-engineer 영역입니다").
