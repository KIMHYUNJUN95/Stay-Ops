# Documentation Index

## Purpose

This index helps humans and AI assistants understand the StayOps documentation structure.

Status labels:

```txt
Confirmed: Decision is currently accepted.
Draft: Direction exists but needs more review before implementation.
Future: Documented for later, not MVP.
Living: Must be updated continuously.
Historical: Retained for decision history but superseded by a newer document or the current implementation.
```

## Current Delivery Checklist

- [x] Core mobile and admin surfaces implemented
- [x] Data model and feature-specific RLS documented
- [x] Supabase project direction confirmed
- [x] Environment variable names documented
- [x] i18n key strategy and hardcoded-string guard established
- [x] Light-mode-only warm-ivory theme contract established
- [ ] Complete physical-device/browser E2E and rollout checks tracked in `planning/13-qa-checklist.md`
- [ ] Verify migration history and required secrets separately for each deployment environment

## Open Decisions To Resolve Soon

- Expense receipt export template and OCR rollout details (`product/29-expense-receipt-workflow.md`)
- Remaining physical-device QA and production rollout checks (`planning/13-qa-checklist.md`)
- Any future dark-mode or native-app direction requires a new explicit decision

## Maintenance Rule

When a document changes status or a new document is added, update this index.
